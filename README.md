# twitterbot
A python twitter bot that searches by keyword and has different replies to tweets it finds. It uses AWS to connect to an S3 bucket in order to save and update a text file of already replied to tweet ID numbers. Imports should be zipped into a folder along with python classes to be executed as an AWS lambda function. Uses the Tweepy, Twitter, AWS API.
